# directory onto the hard drive, log the backup date, and unmount the hard
# drive


# once external hard drive is connected, replace `sdb1` by the device name
# (found with `lsblk`), and replace `/mnt/backup` by your system's mount point
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backup
# replace `/home/eric/work` with the desired work directory you would like to
# backup. rsync is 'smart enough' to only copy files that have been changed
# since the last backup.
